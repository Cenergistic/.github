This guide is for new employees. Follow the steps below to get started with your GitHub account and join our organization.

## Step 1: Sign Up for GitHub

You will need a Github account to contribute source code. Sign up for one with your Cenergistic email address [here](https://github.com/join). Do not use your personal Github account if you already have one.

## Step 2: Accept the Invitation

Once you have an account, you'll receive an invitation via email to join our GitHub organization. Simply click on the link in the email to accept the invitation.

## Step 3: Access Organization Repositories
